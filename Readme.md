# Build smart contract

This learning journey provided a solid base in Ethereum smart contract creation, deployment, and interaction. Engaging in practical exercises and documenting progress on GitHub allowed me to gain practical experience and build a relevant portfolio. I learned to create ERC20 tokens, manage hashed messages on the blockchain, and automate interactions with smart contracts via ethers.js. Moreover, I investigated zkSync and paymasters for managing transaction fees and token balances.
